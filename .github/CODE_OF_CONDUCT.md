# Code of Conduct

We’re building a welcoming, helpful space. Be kind, assume good intent, and keep discussions technical. No harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, or doxxing.

**Reporting:** If you spot behavior that violates this code, please open a private “Security Advisory” (Security → Advisories) or email the maintainers listed in CODEOWNERS. We’ll review and act quickly.

**Scope:** Applies to all repo spaces—issues, PRs, discussions, and any synchronous channels tied to this project.
