# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability or a risky default:
- **Preferred**: Open a private advisory (GitHub → Security → Advisories → “New draft security advisory”).
- Or email the maintainer listed in CODEOWNERS with details and reproduction steps.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and coordinate a fix before public disclosure.
